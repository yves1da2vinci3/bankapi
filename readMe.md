# Bank API

The Bank API is a RESTful API that simulates the backend of a banking application. It provides various endpoints to manage users, transactions, authentication, and authorization. This README provides an overview of the project structure, installation instructions, and available endpoints.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```
├── config              # Configuration files
├── model               # Database-related concerns
│   ├── domain          # Entity definitions
│   ├── repository      # Database queries
│   └── service         # CRUD logic
├── controllers         # Request handling logic
├── logic               # Business logic
├── security            # Authentication and authorization
├── utils               # Utility functions
├── routers             # Route definitions
├── main.go             # Application entry point
├── go.mod              # Go module file
└── go.sum              # Go module checksum file
```

## Installation

To install the required Go modules, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

## Running the Application

You can run the application with the following command:

```bash
go run main.go
```

Make sure you have a PostgreSQL database set up and configured correctly. Update the database connection details in the configuration files.

## Endpoints

- `GET /api/users`: Retrieve a list of users.
- `POST /api/users`: Create a new user.
- `GET /api/users/{id}`: Retrieve a user by ID.
- `PUT /api/users/{id}`: Update a user's information.
- `DELETE /api/users/{id}`: Delete a user.
- `GET /api/transactions`: Retrieve a list of transactions.
- `POST /api/transactions`: Create a new transaction.
- `GET /api/transactions/{id}`: Retrieve a transaction by ID.
- `PUT /api/transactions/{id}`: Update a transaction's details.
- `DELETE /api/transactions/{id}`: Delete a transaction.
- `POST /api/auth/login`: Authenticate a user and generate an access token.
- `POST /api/auth/logout`: Log out a user and invalidate their access token.
- `POST /api/auth/refresh-token`: Refresh the access token.

Please replace `/api/users` and `/api/transactions` with the actual paths to your endpoints. Each endpoint has its purpose, and you should document their usage and expected request/response formats in your application's documentation.

## Authentication

The API uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication. When making authenticated requests, include the access token in the `Authorization` header.

## Authorization

Authorization checks are in place to ensure that users can only access resources they are allowed to. Permissions and roles can be customized based on your application's requirements.
